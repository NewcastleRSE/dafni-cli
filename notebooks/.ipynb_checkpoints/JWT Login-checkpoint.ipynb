The tool is intended to be used to model the impact of large and long-term infrastructure changes on population distribution and growth.\\n\\nThe rationale is to take an official population projection (baseline or variant), internal migration data, and additional official figures for factors that may govern migration (employment, housing, GVA etc). The next step is to construct a spatial interaction model of internal migration from this data that meets some (arbitrary) goodness-of-fit criteria.\\n\\nFollowing this, a scenario must be invented that captures some change or changes given by example a future infrastructure project, for example by increasing the housing stock and/or jobs in a specific region. By reapplying the model to the original input data with the scenario applied, a modified migration O-D matrix is generated.\\n\\nFinally, the change to the O-D matrix can be applied to the original population projection to create a custom variant. The nature of the model means that localised changes have a global impact - so the new variant projection applies to the whole country.',\n",
